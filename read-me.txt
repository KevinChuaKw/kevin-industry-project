Individuals that are looking for a specific service within a specific area can use this map to find the necessary services 
that are required.

They will also be able to save the tags that they have searched for.

the user can add in data that is specific to them i.e. home or specific markers that they want to remember

Target Audience group - Anyone 
Primary need - When there is a specific need to find a particular service (e.g. moneychanger or hair salon). The user
